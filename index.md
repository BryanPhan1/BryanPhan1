### CPSC 120
* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was one of my favorites because it was when I first
    learned to code values to simulate calculating cards in Blackjack.
    The section that I thought was particularly neat was how to create
    unique cases for the Ace card and recalculating that value when it
    is included as an argument in the command line.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a really interesting assignment because it
    introduced me to using functions which allow me to organize and
    section out parts of my code. It was confusing at first understanding
    how parameters are passed and used in functions but over time I got
    the hang of it, making this another of my favorite labs.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 introduced me to modular programming, by separating
    parts of the program into different files. I liked how this made my
    code feel more organized and started to reflect on its usefulness when
    working with larger programs in the future. The header files in
    particular made searching for and using my functions much easier.
